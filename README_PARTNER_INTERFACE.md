# Partner Interface Implementation

## Overview
This implementation creates a dedicated Partner interface that shares some admin features but with limited permissions. Partners can manage their own venues and view bookings related to their properties.

## API Services Added

### Partner Venue Service
- `listMyVenues()` - Get venues owned by the partner
- `addVenue(venueData)` - Add new venue (pending approval)
- `getVenue(id)` - Get specific venue details
- `updateVenue(id, venueData)` - Update venue information
- `deleteVenue(id)` - Delete venue
- `updateVenueStatus(id, status)` - Update venue status

### Partner Booking Service

- `updateBookingStatus(bookingId, status)` - Confirm/cancel bookings
- `getBookingDetails(bookingId)` - Get detailed booking information

### Partner Stats Service
- `getPartnerStats()` - Get dashboard statistics for partner

## Routing Setup

### Protected Routes
All partner routes are protected with role-based access control:

```javascript
<Route path="/partner/*" element={
  <ProtectedRoute allowedRoles={['partner']}>
    <PartnerPanel />
  </ProtectedRoute>
}>
  <Route path="dashboard" element={<PartnerDashboard />} />
  <Route path="venues" element={<PartnerManageVenue />} />
  <Route path="venues/new" element={<PartnerAddVenue />} />
  <Route path="venues/edit/:id" element={<PartnerEditVenue />} />
  <Route path="bookings" element={<PartnerViewBookings />} />
  <Route path="notifications" element={<PartnerNotifications />} />
  <Route path="profile" element={<PartnerProfile />} />
</Route>
```

## Key Features

### 1. Role-Based Access Control
- `ProtectedRoute` component checks user roles
- Automatic redirection based on user role after login
- Utility functions for role checking (`isPartner()`, `canManageVenues()`, etc.)

### 2. Partner Dashboard
- Shows partner-specific statistics (venues, bookings, revenue)
- Quick action buttons for common tasks
- Error handling with fallback data

### 3. Venue Management
- Partners can only see and manage their own venues
- Add new venues (subject to admin approval)
- Edit existing venue details
- View venue-specific bookings

### 4. Booking Management
- View all bookings for partner's venues
- Confirm or cancel pending bookings
- Search and filter bookings

### 5. Shared Components
- `VenueCard` - Reusable venue display component
- `BookingTable` - Reusable booking table with role-specific actions
- Consistent styling with admin interface

## Security Considerations

### Frontend Protection
- Route-level protection with `ProtectedRoute`
- Role checking utilities
- JWT token validation

### API Security
- All API calls include JWT token in headers
- Partner-specific endpoints should validate ownership on backend
- Status updates require proper authorization

## Backend API Endpoints Needed

```
GET    /partner/venues           # List partner's venues
POST   /partner/venues/new       # Add new venue
GET    /partner/venues/:id       # Get venue details
PUT    /partner/venues/update/:id # Update venue
DELETE /partner/venues/delete/:id # Delete venue
PATCH  /partner/venues/status/:id # Update venue status

GET    /partner/bookings         # List partner's bookings
PATCH  /partner/bookings/:id/status # Update booking status
GET    /partner/bookings/:id     # Get booking details

GET    /partner/stats            # Get partner statistics
```
